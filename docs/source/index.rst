Welcome to sgl's documentation!
===============================

Welcome to the documentation for SGL! Soon, this will actually contain, like, useful things.

Until then, please look over the source code to figure out what's going on. I think I've made it logical enough to understand. There's going to be a lot of this going to change, though. Just warning you.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   sgl-core-ref


Indices and tables
